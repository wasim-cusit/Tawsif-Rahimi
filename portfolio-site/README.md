# CreativeFolio – Multi-page Responsive Portfolio

A 4-page responsive website designed to match a clean Figma style and built with semantic HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

## Pages
- `index.html` – Home (hero, features, portfolio, testimonials, CTA)
- `about.html` – About (intro, timeline, skills)
- `services.html` – Services (cards, pricing, FAQ)
- `contact.html` – Contact (form, info, map placeholder)

## Tech
- Bootstrap 5 via CDN
- Google Fonts (Inter)
- Custom styles in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Minimal JS in `assets/js/main.js`

## How to Run
- Just open `index.html` in your browser.
- Use Chrome DevTools to test responsiveness (Toggle Device Toolbar).

## Figma to Code Checklist
1. Create the design in Figma with at least 3 pages that match the site pages.
2. Use a consistent theme (colors, fonts, spacing). This build uses Inter and indigo #4f46e5.
3. Export PNG/JPG of each page at 1x and place them in `design/screenshots/`.
4. Ensure layout, colors, fonts, and buttons match between Figma and the code.

## Submission Deliverables
- All project files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Figma screenshots in `design/screenshots/`
- Zip the folder and submit

## Notes
- Replace placeholder SVGs in `images/` with your own assets if desired.
- The contact form is a demo (no backend). It shows a success alert on submit.
